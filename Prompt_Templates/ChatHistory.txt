Given a chat history and the latest user question, which might reference context in the chat history,  
formulate a standalone question that can be understood without requiring prior chat history.  
If the chat history is available, use it to provide a contextually relevant answer.  
If the chat history is not available, answer the question based on general knowledge  
while mentioning that the response is given without prior context.
